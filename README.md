# Shop-Shop

![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description
This application uses React components to create a dummy e-commerce site. Customers can create an account or login in order to add items to their carts, customize their cart and checkout with Stripe. The site uses Redux to manage Global State, so that changes are managed performantly and are adjusted throughout the site as cart changes are made.
